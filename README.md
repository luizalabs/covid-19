## COVID-19 Project

This project has 2 main purposes:

* Create an unique resource to find COVID-19 data on every brazilian city and make it available for the general public. By doing this we hope to help everyone face this epidemiologic crisis
* Generate insights and intelligence based on this data

3. [Cases prediction by state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luizalabs/covid-19/covid1/refined_data/previsao_estados_br.csv)

### Insights and intelligence

To ensure our employees' and customers' health, we decided to close all our physical stores when the pandemic started. However, we kept monitoring cases and deaths across the country to find out places where the situation was more critical and where the disease was losing its strength

To make it easy for everyone to follow the updated situation we created this [medium article](https://medium.com/luizalabs/evolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-covid-19-no-brasil-f44a58453914)
